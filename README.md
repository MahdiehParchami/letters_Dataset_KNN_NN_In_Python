Implementing KNN and NN Machine learning Models on Letters dataset

I use a letters dataset and perform k nearest neighbors and neural network machine learning algorithms to predict students' handwriting.
I perform k nearest neighbors and neural network machine learning algorithms to predict handwriting and then I use benchmarking metrics 
to compare the results and recommend the better model to a school.
In this study I applied two different machine learning algorithms, k nearest neighbors and neural networks, to predict students' handwriting. 
The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing data, with feature scaling applied to standardize and improve the performance of the models. 
benchmarking metrics were used to compare the two models. The results showed that the KNN model gave better accuracy, precision, recall, and speed 
than neural networks, hence it was recommended for use with this dataset.
